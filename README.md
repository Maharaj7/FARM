# FARMThe Farmers Market was founded to assist farmers with the hassle of marketing their crops to consumers. They have decided to enlist the services of your team to assist them with the following services: 1) Registering a new farmer to the service 2) Allowing farmers to manage their crop inventory 3) Allowing customers to register for the service 4) Allowing customers to purchase crops 
 
This service delivery will be made possible through the installment of several kiosks at different publicly accessible venues and pickup points. Farmers and customers should benefit from the faster response time and added convenience. 
 
You are expected to create a client-server application to facilitate the aforementioned features remotely. Both customers and farmers will use clients to communicate with a central server hosted in the cloud by the Farmer’s Market “DevOps” team. Using this centralized architecture for the server application will allow easier maintenance, since any member from the “DevOps” team may remotely access the server when necessary. Deployment of the client application is also low cost because of the portability of the benefit of using the Java programming language. 
 
Your team which uses SCRUM to manage projects has the following expectations: 1) System Name: Free Agri-Relations Management  (FARM) 2) Database should only be accessible by server 3) Remote Procedure Call (RPC) / Remote Method Invocation (RMI)  to be used  4) Logging should be on client side and server side 5) Appropriate exception handling 6) Graphical User Interface should be implemented as a Multi-document Interface (MDI)
